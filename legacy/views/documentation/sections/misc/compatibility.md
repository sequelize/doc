#### Compatibility

Sequelize is compatible to the following versions of Node.JS:

* 0.8.x
* 0.6.x
* ~~0.5.10~~
* ~~0.4.12~~

**HINT:** Compatibility for versions `< 0.6` was dropped with Sequelize `v1.4.1`. It might still work with Node.JS v0.4.x but as tests were moved to BusterJS, total test coverage for `< v0.6` was not possible anymore.
