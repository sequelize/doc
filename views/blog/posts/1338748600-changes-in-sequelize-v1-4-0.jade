      h2 Changes in Sequelize v1.4.0

      h3 Teaser
      p
        | Sequelize v1.4.0 was released in April 2012. Besides some
        | important bugfixes, the new version shipped also major improvements
        | as support for PostgreSQL, compatibility to <code>JSON.stringify</code>,
        | connection pooling for MySQL, the possibility to set a date’s default
        | value to the current date, as well as the chance to customize the logging strategy.

      h3 PostgreSQL support
      p
        | Due to the great work of
        | <a href="https://github.com/swoodtke" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shawn Woodtke</a>,
        | Sequelize is from v1.4.0 on compatible to PostgreSQL. This means it can for example
        | be used with Heroku! Massive win :) The documentation about that feature can be
        | found <a href="/docs/latest/usage#dialects">here</a>.

      p
        | So, if you want to use PostgreSQL, you need to install the library <code>pg</code>.
        | The best way to do it is either automagically via <code>npm install pg --save</code>
        | or manually via adding <code>pg</code> to the <code>package.json</code> file:

      pre.dark-blue
        code.javascript
          | {
          |   "name": "my project",
          |   // ...
          |   "dependencies": {
          |     // ...
          |     "pg": "0.6.x",
          |     "sequelize": "1.3.x",
          |     // ...
          |   }
          |   // ...
          | }

      p Furthermore it is necessary to define the dialect when instantiating Sequelize:

      pre.dark-blue
        code.javascript
          | var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
          |   dialect: 'postgres'
          | })

      h3 JSON.stringify
      p
        | One often reported issue was the incompatibility of objects to
        | <code>JSON.stringify</code>. In the past you got an error saying
        | something about circular references. Instead of that error, you
        | will now get a map of all attributes and it’s values.

      h3 Connection pooling (MySQL)
      p
        | <a href="https://github.com/megshark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meg Sharkey</a>
        | added (again :D) support for connection pooling for MySQL. You can
        | use pooling in order to reduce db connection overload and to increase
        | speed of db queries. To activate it, you have to do this:

      pre.dark-blue
        code.javascript
          | var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
          |   pool: { maxConnections: 5, maxIdleTime: 30 }
          | })

      h3 Default value for date attributes
      p
        | You can now define, that a date’s value should be the current
        | time by default. This is how to do it:

      pre.dark-blue
        code.javascript
          | var User = sequelize.define('users', {
          |   myDate: { type: Sequelize.DATE, defaultValue: Sequelize.NOW }
          | })

      h3 Bug fixes
